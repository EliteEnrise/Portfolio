## üëã Short Introduction
I am **Enrise**, a fellow proeficient in multiple languages and domains.
Past my time here on Roblox, I have done practically anything that can be done on the platform, ranging from applied math, complex physics, gun systems, vehicles, frameworks, general systems, simulator games, SCPF games, etc...
Therefore, **I can do anything and not limited to any specific tasks**.

## üåü Experience
I have been programming with Roblox Lua for the past *6-7 years* (soon 8), C++/C for more than *4 years*, Python for more than *3 years*, and a newbie to Rust; I have wide knowledge of Reverse Engineering, Software Engineering, Open-Source Intelligence, etc.
I am constantly up-to-date with any Roblox update and should never use anything that has been replaced or can be done in any way *better*, one example being: template literals (string interpolation).

## üõ† Showcase
I can say confidently that I have done more than **100+** tasks, and I will be displaying a few of what I have done down below:

### Style
‚ö†Ô∏è *Caution: If you do not possess any basic knowledge regarding programming, most of the words in here will not make logic.*

‚ùìÔ∏è **NC** - naming convention

üîé I use a constant style across all of my career, custom to all languages.
In Luau, specifically, I use the *PascalCase* NC for globally accessible variables, *camelCase* for anything else, exclusions making constants where I utilize *SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE*.

*Example of a recursive factorial with additional style addons*
```lua
-- Services...
local Players: Players = game:GetService("Players")

-- Constants...
local BASE_WALKSPEED: number = 16

-- ...
local function factorial(num: number)
    return if num == 1 then num else num * factorial(num - 1)
end
```
